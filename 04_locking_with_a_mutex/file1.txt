Hi
I am twelve
I love my family
My father is a doctor
My mother is a manager
My brother is a hunter
She is strict
I go to school every morning
And I need to do my homework everyday
But I am always lazy
I am a very handsome boy
I have dark hair and blue eyes
I have a lot of friends
I am not as clever as my brother
He is already twenty
And we spend much time together
